      <h3 id="headline">Here's some of the famous Van Gogh painting series</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflowers_(Van_Gogh_series)"><strong>Sunflowers:</strong></a> Sunflowers (original title, in French: Tournesols) is the title of two series of still life paintings. The first series, executed in Paris in 1887, depicts the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set, made a year later in Arles, shows a bouquet of sunflowers in a vase.</li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Paul_Asylum,_Saint-R%C3%A9my_(Van_Gogh_series)"><strong>Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Rémy:</strong></a> Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Rémy is a collection of paintings that Vincent van Gogh made when he was a self-admitted patient at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, since renamed the Clinique Van Gogh, from May 1889 until May 1890.</li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portraits_of_Vincent_van_Gogh"><strong>Self-Portraits:</strong></a> The portraits of Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) are the self-portraits, portraits of him by other artists, and photographs—one of which is dubious—of the Dutch artist. Van Gogh's dozens of self-portraits were an important part of his œuvre as a painter.</li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Trees_(Van_Gogh_series)"><strong>Olive Trees:</strong></a> Vincent van Gogh painted at least 15 paintings of olive trees, mostly in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in 1889. At his own request, he lived at an asylum there from May 1889 through May 1890 painting the gardens of the asylum and, when he had permission to venture outside its walls, nearby olive trees, cypresses and wheat fields.</li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_Orchards"><strong>Flowering Orchards:</strong></a> Flowering Orchards is a series of paintings which Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh executed in Arles, in southern France in the spring of 1888. Van Gogh arrived in Arles in February 1888 in a snowstorm; within two weeks the weather changed and the fruit trees were in blossom. Appreciating the symbolism of rebirth, Van Gogh worked with optimism and zeal on about fourteen paintings of flowering trees in the early spring. He also made paintings of flowering trees in Saint-Rémy the following year, in 1889.</li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Fields"><strong>Wheat Fields:</strong></a> Wheat Fields is a series of dozens of paintings by Dutch Post-Impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh, borne out of his religious studies and sermons, connection to nature, appreciation of manual laborers and desire to provide a means of offering comfort to others.</li>
